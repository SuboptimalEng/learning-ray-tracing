# üåÑ Raytracer in JavaScript

This repo contains the code for my raytracer built in JavaScript. I made it using Pete Shirley's
book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) as a reference.

Each folder is self-contained and built incrementally on the previous one. Some folders which
have the name `code-clean-up` are just a refactored version of the previous folder. Here's an
example of how you can run the `08-metal-materials` demo:

```
git clone https://github.com/SuboptimalEng/raytracer-js.git
cd raytracer-js/08-metal-materials/
npm install
npm run dev
```
