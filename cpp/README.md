# ðŸ“š Ray Tracing in C++

This repo contains the code for my ray tracer built in C++. Each folder is
self-contained and built incrementally on the previous one. Here's an example
of how you can run the `00-output-image` demo on MacOS:

```
git clone https://github.com/SuboptimalEng/raytracer-js.git
cd ray-tracing/cpp/00-output-image/
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp
./a.out >> image.ppm
# open the image.pmm file in finder
```
